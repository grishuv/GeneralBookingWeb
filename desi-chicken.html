        <h1>Country Chicken vs. Broiler Chicken: Which One is Better for You</h1>
        <p>
            I often talk about the difference between country chicken and broiler chicken with all my clients. This is important to know because many people care about what they eat and where it comes from. And why should you not be? It’s your body, and you should know what you are taking in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Country chicken, also known as free-range or organic chicken, is different from broiler chicken, which is raised on big farms. These chickens are different in how they taste, how they feel to eat, and what they do for our health.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, I am going to look at how the way these chickens are raised and what they eat changes how good they are for us. It’s really helpful to know this so we can make better choices about what we eat based on what’s good for our health and what we think is right.

                <h3>Country Chicken</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Country chickens are also called free-range or backyard chickens. They live in a more natural way. These chickens get to walk around in open spaces, which is good for them because they can act like chickens naturally do.                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They look for their own food, like bugs, grass, and seeds. This is good for their health and makes their meat different from chickens that don’t live this way.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Broiler chickens are the kind you see a lot in stores. They are kept in big farms where everything is controlled. These chickens are bred to grow really fast and get big enough to be sold in a short time.                    </li>
                    <li>Their diet is specially made for them and includes things like grains and soybean meal. This diet helps them grow quickly but doesn’t give them the same variety as the diet of country chickens.                    </li>

                    <li>Country chickens usually have less fat because they move around more and have a natural diet. On average, if you take 100 grams of country chicken meat, it has about 3-5 grams of fat. This makes it a leaner choice, which can be good if you’re trying to eat less fat. </li>

                    <li>Broiler chickens often have a bit more fat compared to country chickens. This is partly because they grow really fast and eat a diet that makes them bigger quickly.
