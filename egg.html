                <h2>Desi Eggs</h2>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Whether you are a non-vegetarian or an eggetarian, the love for eggs as an essential source of protein is universal and cross-cultural. The importance of eggs in the Indian diet was especially immortalised by the popular jingle from the 1980s, ‘’Sunday ho ya Monday, Roz Khao Ande”. The idea behind this campaign initiated by the National Egg Coordination Committee of India was to raise greater awareness about the nutritional value of eggs and the benefit of harnessing them by incorporating eggs into your daily diet irrespective of the day of the week.</p>

                <h2>Brown egg vs. white egg, which is healthier for weight loss?</h2>
                <p>The egg is the complete source of protein. All 9 essential amino acids (which the body cannot synthesize) are present in eggs. So regular consumption of eggs provides quality proteins. Based on one’s preferences one can either go for brown or white.</p>
                
                <!-- Differences between brown and white eggs -->
                <p>There is a rising trend amongst health-conscious people to consume everything brown, whether it be brown bread, brown rice or brown or wholewheat pasta. While consuming wholewheat carbohydrates definitely have merit attached to it, consuming brown eggs is not the same thing.</p>
                <p>First things first, scientifically, there are no nutritional differences between brown eggs and white eggs in terms of health benefits. The only difference is in the pigment of the shell and the hygiene associated with it at the time of breeding. Brown eggs are hatched by chickens of darker colour while white eggs are laid by the white coloured breed. Additionally, brown eggs are often sold as organic and priced higher than white eggs because they are bred in a more hygienic environment and fed healthier food.</p>
                <p>So, whether you consume the brown egg or the white egg, there is no nutrition.</p>
